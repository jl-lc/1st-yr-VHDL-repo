## Project 2 - VHDL ALU
The ALU takes 2 4-bit inputs from the 8 switches on the board and displays each 4-bit input as a hexadecimal digit on each of the 7-segment displays.
A push button can be pushed to switch the output into the sum of the 2 4-bit inputs and display on the same 2 7-segment displays. Used behavioural and 
structural styles of modelling. Simulated on waveforms and demo'd on board.
