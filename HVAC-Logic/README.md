## Project 3 - VHDL HVAC Logic
HVAC Logic is a HVAC simulator. The first 4 switches are inputs for the desired temperature to be maintained. The next 4 switches are input for the desired 
vacation temperature to be maintained. The push buttons are inputs for different modes and settings: vacation mode, test mode, window open, door open. The 
LEDS represents: the furnace, at temperature, air conditioner, blower, winder, door, test pass, and vacation. 1 7-segment display shows the current 
temperature and the second 7-segment display shows the desired temperature. Depending on the different inputs of the switches and push buttons, the combination 
of furnace, AC, and blower would be on or off, as well as the current temperature will increment or decrement until it matches the desired temperature. 
Simulated on waveforms and demo'd on board.
